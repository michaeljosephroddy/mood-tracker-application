# Mood Tracker Application

Developed a mood tracking application for Object Oriented Programming 2 module to demonstrate proficiency with modern Java features. The application allows users to track their moods by creating, reading, filtering, and managing mood entries, incorporating both fundamental and advanced Java language features. Key features included:

- Utilised functional programming with lambdas/functional interfaces (e.g. Consumer, Predicate, Function, Supplier).
- Employed the Stream API for data processing, including terminal operations (min(), max(), count(), findFirst(), etc.) and intermediate operations (filter(), map(), sorted(), etc.)
- Used Collectors.toMap(), groupingBy(), and partitioningBy() for advanced data aggregation.
- Modern language constructs such as switch expressions, pattern matching, sealed classes, and records.
- Managed date and time with the Date/Time API.
- Applied advanced collection handling with generics, including sorting using Comparator.comparing().

## Running the Application
